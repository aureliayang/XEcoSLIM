# XEcoSLIM  
We build the deep learning model to further accelerate the GPU version EcoSLIM.
As the first step, we directly adopted the DNN model for flow visuallization from Han et al. (2022).
Currently, we are training the model based on hillslope model.
Please stay tuned for the amazing results!
