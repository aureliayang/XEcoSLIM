# *X*EcoSLIM  
## We build the deep learning model to further accelerate the GPU version EcoSLIM.  
As the first step, we directly adopted  
(1) A DNN model from fluid dynamics  
(2) Neural ODE  
Currently, we are training the DL model based on hillslope physical model and modifying the DL model to adapt water age simulations.  

**Demonstration**  
**One year prediction of multi-point trajectories**

**Therefore, our work is easy to be applied to predict transport of plumes.**
