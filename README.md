# *X*EcoSLIM  
## We build the deep learning model to further accelerate the GPU version EcoSLIM.  
As the first step, we directly adopted the fancy DNN model based on Pytorch from fluid dynamics.  
Currently, we are training the DL model based on hillslope physical model and modifying the DL model to adapt water age simulations.  
**Please stay tuned for the amazing results at AGU23!**
